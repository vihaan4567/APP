•	You will have a better chance of surviving if everyone in the family agrees on a plan before cyclone season.
•	Make sure you have a battery-powered radio as part of your emergency kit, in case of power failure and mobile networks going down.

•	Decide how you will look after your pets and animals and what you will do if you have to leave them behind.
